                        2.1. Our Services provide a platform that enables individuals (“Users”) to buy, sell, and barter goods with each other (combined as “Trading” or “Trade”). Any decision by a User to enter into a transaction with another User is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion and at their own risk. While BarterBread helps Users connect, all transactions occur solely between Users. This means that you are solely responsible for all of your Trading activities, including communications, items, meetups, exchanges, and compliance with any applicable laws. This further means that:
                        <ol>
                            <li>You should use your best judgment when Trading goods. For example, you may not want to meet with individuals that you are not comfortable Trading with, or you may want to meet in a public and secure location;</li>
                            <li>You are responsible for resolving all questions, comments, and complaints about your items. You should be thorough in your postings and clear in your communications. Returns, refunds, and exchanges shall be dealt with between Users;</li>
                            <li>You are responsible for completing your Trade, and for fulfilling all promises, representations, or warranties you make to your Trading partners in connection with the Trade;</li>
                            <li>You are responsible for all taxes and fees associated with your Trading activities. You must collect, report, and/or pay the correct amounts to the appropriate authorities, if applicable, and if needed, inform your customers about any taxes they may be required to pay and issue appropriate invoices;</li>
                            <li>You must not violate our <a href="{{ url('/user-guidelines') }}">User Guidelines</a>.</li>
