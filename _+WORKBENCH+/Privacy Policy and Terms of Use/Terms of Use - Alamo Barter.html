                            <p>The following additional provisions  (hereinafter referred to as "Terms &amp; Conditions") form a part of and are  incorporated by reference and made a part of the Trade Account Application and  Agreement (Client Agreement") between Client and Alamo Barter Corporation.&nbsp; These Terms and Conditions are also posted on  the ABC website, <a href="http://www.alamobarter.com/">www.alamobarter.com</a></p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>Any trade purchase or sale by Client  constitutes acceptance of these Terms &amp; Conditions as may from time to time  be amended in accordance herewith.</p>
                            <p><strong>1.&nbsp;Nature of the Parties</strong></p>
                            <p>ABC is a trading company  that also acts as a clearinghouse and third party record keeper of barter  transactions among its clients, which are businesses that contract with ABC to  organize and facilitate barter of their goods and services with other clients.&nbsp; "Client" is a business or individual that has  contracted with ABC to exchange its goods and/or services with other Clients  and wishes to subscribe to ABC record keeping and barter services.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Nature of Trade Dollars</strong></p>
                            <p>A "trade" is a barter  purchase or sale of goods and/or services whereby payment is made in trade  dollars posted to Client’s account pursuant to these Terms and Conditions.&nbsp; A trade dollar is an accounting unit used to  record the value of trades.&nbsp; Ownership of  trade dollars denotes the right to receive goods or services available within  the ABC trade network.&nbsp; Trade dollars may  be used only in the manner and for the purpose set forth in these Terms and  Conditions.&nbsp; They will not be considered  legal tender, securities or commodities.&nbsp;  They will not be redeemed for cash.&nbsp;  ABC disclaims responsibility for the negotiability of trade dollars or for  the availability of goods and services from any source.</p>
                            <p><strong>3. Liability for Trade Dollars</strong></p>
                            <p>Client acknowledges that  trade dollars in the barter system (positive balances) are the liabilities of  persons who have spent more than their earnings (negative balances); that there  is a creditor/debtor relationship between such persons, and that trade  transactions incur the normal business risks associated with any credit  transaction.&nbsp; As a general rule, trade  dollars are the liabilities of Client who owe the barter system, and not of  ABC, which is solely liable for its own indebtedness.&nbsp; ABC is authorized to establish a bad debt  reserve fund by charging all accounts on a regular basis an amount in trade  dollars to be paid into such fund.&nbsp; Any  positive balances abandoned or surrendered by former members in accordance with  these Terms and Conditions may also be paid into the reserve fund.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>4. Trade Dollar Loans</strong></p>
                            <p>Client grants to ABC the  right and power to make trade dollar loans to any Client on terms and  conditions consistent with a client’s credit worthiness and ability to  repay.&nbsp; The exercise of this power shall  be at sole discretion of ABC management with regard to principal, interest,  terms and conditions, lending policy and other particulars.&nbsp; Clients wishing to apply for a loan may be  required to submit a loan application, financial statement, credit agreement,  promissory note or equivalent collateral prior to approval.&nbsp; ABC is under no obligation to extend credit  at any time.&nbsp; If a negative trade balance  exists in the client’s account when account is canceled by ABC or Client as  outlined in these Terms &amp; Conditions, ABC will require that the Client pay  the balance immediately in cash.&nbsp; All credit  lines are personally guaranteed by the individual signing the Client Agreement  as set forth in Section 36 hereof .</p>
                            <p><strong>5. Brokerage Function</strong></p>
                            <p>ABC serves in a brokerage  capacity in organizing and facilitating trades among Clients.&nbsp; Responsibility for the conduct of a trade is  exclusively that of the two Clients participating in the trade.&nbsp; The duty to inspect goods for quality and  quantity rests upon the buyer.&nbsp; ABC will  use its best efforts to broker the trade dollars of clients into goods and  services, to accurately record trades, and to administer these Terms and  Conditions in accordance with its terms.&nbsp;  However, Clients acknowledge that the sole principals in any trades are  the buying and selling Clients involved, that trades are entered into  voluntarily, and ABC is not the guarantor of any trade or trade dollar Client  has the obligation to determine whether the provider of any services possesses  the competency and professionalism to adequately provide such service to the  Client.</p>
                            <p>ABC is functioning in a brokerage  capacity and Client does hereby indemnify and hold ABC harmless with respect to  any claim, debt, or liability whatsoever, arising out of any trade exchange  transaction where Client is a buyer or seller.</p>

                            <p>ABC shall use its best  efforts to solicit new businesses having products or services to satisfy the  needs of all Clients.&nbsp; ABC is not  responsible if a Client cannot find specific products or services to buy from  the other Clients.</p>
                            <p><strong>7. Definition of Client in Good Standing</strong></p>
                            <p>A Client who conducts  trades in accordance with these Terms and Conditions is current in any monies  owning to ABC, and has a valid Client account, is to be considered a "client in  good standing."&nbsp; Only Clients in good  standing are entitled to the services of ABC and to otherwise participate in  trades with other Clients.</p>
                            <p><strong>8. Referral Bonus</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>9. Use of Trade Certificates  (debit cards, gift certificates, and scrip) </strong></p>
                            <p>The following rules govern  the use of Debit Cards, Gift Certificates, and Scrip.&nbsp; Once Trade Certificates are purchased, they  cannot and will not be replaced if lost, stolen, or damaged.&nbsp; Trade Certificates should be used as soon as  possible after they are purchased, and must be used before their expiration  date.&nbsp; All tips, gratuities, and sales  taxes must be paid in cash at the point of purchase by the buying client.&nbsp; ABC reserves the right to refuse to sell  Trade Certificates to clients who have previously refused to pay the proper  taxes and gratuities or have created other problems at restaurants or other  selling establishments.&nbsp; ABC is not  responsible if a business refuses to accept Trade Certificates and ABC will not  make restitution for any cash charges that Client may incur.&nbsp; ABC will not extend expiration dates and/or  buy back Trade Certificates that are expired.&nbsp;  All disputes concerning the use of a Trade Certificates are between the  Client and the business issuing the Trade Certificate, and ABC bears no  liability in the event the issuing business refuses to honor the Trade  Certificate or ceases to operate the business.</p>
