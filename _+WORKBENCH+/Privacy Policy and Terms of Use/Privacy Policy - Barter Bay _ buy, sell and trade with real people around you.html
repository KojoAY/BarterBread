(hereinafter, “Barter Bay”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). Your privacy is critically important to us. At Barter Bay, we have a few fundamental principles:</p><ul class="jsx-2297323224"><li class="jsx-2297323224">We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224">We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224">We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li></ul><p class="jsx-2297323224">Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles. Please take time to read our Privacy Policy carefully. By providing personal information to us, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">1. Who we are</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">1.1. We are an online, buy, sell, bartering platform that aims to reduce waste by providing a service that allows people to exchange their products. Individuals (“Users”) can converse with each other to trade. We believe that our strongest advantage is to enable people to explore the second-hand economy through our platform and save money while staying conscientious of waste.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">2. Services covered by this Policy</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">2.1. This Privacy policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p><ol class="jsx-2297323224"><li class="jsx-2297323224">Our website (barterbay.ca);</li><li class="jsx-2297323224">Our mobile application (Barter Bay mobile app for Android and iOS); and</li><li class="jsx-2297323224">Other products and services that are available or through our website and mobile application.</li></ol><p class="jsx-2297323224">2.2. Throughout this privacy Policy, we will refer to our website, mobile application, and other products and services collectively as “Services”. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you. This Privacy Policy covers your use of our Services. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">3. Information we collect</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">3.1. We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so. For example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us; automatically through operating our services; and, from outside sources.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">4. Information you provide</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">4.1. It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">a. Basic account information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to setup your account (your “Account”). For example, we require a way to contact Users for Account verification and password reset. If you connect with us through social media, we need the necessary information to verify and secure your Account. Administrative notifications may require methods of contact, such as an emails or push notifications.</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">b. Public information:</strong> Information you post on our Services may be public and available to other Users and the general public. For example, if you have an Account with us, we require that you fill out a first name and a last name. You may edit them as necessary, and they are considered to be public information. Your profile picture may be used when using our Services. We allow Users to communicate with each other, and you may receive unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may disclose to third parties. It behooves you to take extra care when you disclose information through our Services.</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">c. Transaction and billing information:</strong> If you purchase something from us (such as a subscription or a service), you will have to provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">d. Content information:</strong> You may also provide us with information about you when using our Services. For example, when you create a listing, you may include a description of your item and items you want in exchange. We will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the internet, if you choose to list an item. We may use these information for our own advertising purposes (such as for social media, Facebook ads).</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">e. Instant messaging:</strong> We may collect information from our instant messaging Services. This is because we are using a third party provider for our messaging services, and we require these data to migrate without data loss. Our instant messaging service is intended to help people buy, sell, and barter. Information you share over this service may be transferred, stored, and processed. Please be careful of what you share over communications.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">5. Information we collect from you automatically</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">a. Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services. For example, when you create a new listing on Barter Bay.</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">b. Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that users perform on our Services - in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g. when User A makes an offer to User B). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., number of pages fetched in a session) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">c. Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address, satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions and to provide security checks against unauthorized access.</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">d. Stored information:</strong> We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile app. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you post an item on Barter Bay.</p><p class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">e. Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Barter Bay uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. You may instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use or access certain Services. If you do not instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, your consent to our use of your personal information may be implied.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">6. Information we collect from other sources</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">6.1. We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your Barter Bay Account through another service (like Facebook), we will receive information from that service (such as your name, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p><p class="jsx-2297323224">6.2. We may also get information from third party services about individuals who are not yet our Users (…but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">7. Restricting what you share</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">7.1. You may be able to use our Services without providing personal information. However, the Services we provide may not work as intended or cease to function if you choose not to provide required information, such as your email in order to “Activate” your Account.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">8. Membership and registration</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">8.1. Certain Services may require you to be verified. Your email, social media account, or other third party sources may be used in order to validate you. We, and our service providers, may also collect other information from you, including your birthday, phone number, address, gender, and other information granted by the social media account and any other additional third party social network. For example, Facebook provides us information used for authentication. The information we collect from such sources may include people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected. Registering with Barter Bay with a social media account means that you are allowing Barter Bay to access personal information associated with these sources.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">9. Email newsletters and push notifications</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">9.1. We may contact you and/or send you commercial information by email and/or push notifications, to inform Account information, products and services, offers, or any commercial contents. You may opt-out of communications and notifications if you do not want to receive commercial communications. However, you may still receive administrative communications such as updates and changes associated with your Account.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">10.

How we share information</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">11.1. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p><ol class="jsx-2297323224"><li class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">Subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">Third party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers). Third parties may include service providers who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other services.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">As required by law:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">To protect rights and property:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Barter Bay, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, or in the unlikely event that Barter Bay goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, User information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services you connect with Barter Bay. You provide us with implied consent where our purpose for collecting, using or disclosing your information would be considered obvious or reasonable in the circumstances. Your consent may also be implied where you have received notice and a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of having your information used, and you have not provided us with notice of your opting-out, including but not limited to use for mail-outs, marketing or fundraising.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">Aggregated and de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.</li><li class="jsx-2297323224"><strong class="jsx-2297323224">Published support requests:</strong> And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other Users.</li></ol><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">12. Information shared publicly</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">12.1. Information that you choose to make public is - you guessed it - disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like your public profile, listings, other content that you make public on our Services, are all available to others. We provide public data (like listings) from our Services for anyone to browse. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">13. What we do to secure your information</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">13.1. We work very hard to protect your information in our custody and control against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. However, no transmission over the internet is completely secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, and other breaches will never occur. Our Services are for you to use at your own risk. We recommend you to apply caution to the information you share and to be prompt in changing your password when it is no longer secure. If you believe that your information with us is no longer secure, please contact us immediately.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">14. Transferring information</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">14.1. Barter Bay is a worldwide service. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to Canada and other countries, which may have rights and protections that are different from those in your home country.</p><h2 class="jsx-2297323224">15. Third parties</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">15.1. This Privacy Policy covers only the Services Barter Bay provides. We are not responsible for the privacy, information or other practices of any other third parties, including any other third parties our Services connects, communicates with, or uses.

We may use other third parties in the future to expand our Services (such as a payment system for premium services). Your information may be collected by these third parties.

Translation</h2><p class="jsx-2297323224">17.1. This Privacy Policy is originally written in English. We may translate these terms into other languages.

If we make changes, we will notify you to review our most current Policy, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as sending you a notification through email).
