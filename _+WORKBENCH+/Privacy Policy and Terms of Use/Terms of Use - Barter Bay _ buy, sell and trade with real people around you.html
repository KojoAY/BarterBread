You shall retain ownership of any views, opinions, reviews, ratings, comments, content or material you submit, display, distribute, upload, post, share, publish or otherwise make publicly available on or through the Services (the “User Content”). You grant (and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant) to Barter Bay an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works including for marketing purposes, and otherwise use and exploit your User Content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing rights.
