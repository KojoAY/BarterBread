                    <h5>Last updated: June 01, 2019</h5>

                    <p>
                        We at BarterBread respects your right to freedom of speech. While we are based in Accra, Ghana, we recognize that our users are diverse, and come from many cultural backgrounds. We respect your rights to freely express ideas and opinions, and we do this by providing neither censorship nor endorsement. However, there are categories of behavior and content that we do not permit because we consider them to be harmful to our community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We want you to be well-informed of our guidelines, so we try to keep them simple and transparent. Below lists the activities and materials that are not allowed on BarterBread.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Illegal content and conduct</h2>
                        Self-explanatory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Misleading information</h2>
                        We do not tolerate attempts to deceive or defraud users. Please be honest in your exchanges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Intellectual property infringement</h2>
                        Please respect the intellectual property of others. When in doubt, always ask the owner of the content for permission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Pornography</h2>

                    <p>
                        <h2>Harmful or malicious content</h2>
                        Please do not upload or link to any malicious or destructive code. Avoid clicking or contributing to any questionable links.

                        <h2>Impersonation</h2>
                        Do not claim to be someone or a company that you are not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Directly threatening material</h2>
                        Do not post threats of violence, personal information, or any material that could be harmful or lead to loss of life. Respect people’s privacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <h2>Harassment</h2>
                        Do not harass people. We understand that words can translate poorly over the internet, and sometimes offense is not intentional. Please be considerate when communicating with others.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <h2>Advertising</h2>

                    <p>

                        <h2>Spam</h2>
                        Please do not send any unwanted or unsolicited promotions or emails, machine-generated or otherwise. We do not like spam, neither do our users. Users may be away or busy. Give them time to respond.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <h2>Animals</h2>
                        Please do not post or trade any endangered animals or products made from endangered animals (such as ivory).
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <h2>Risk to health and safety</h2>
                        Used personal items carry an inherent risk. The risk for disease transmission may be small, but they exist. You need to be aware of this when exchanging any item.
                    </p>
